# Unexpected Null Handling in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in JavaScript related to unexpected null handling within an addition function.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function adds two numbers. It explicitly handles `null` values by returning 0.  While this approach is valid, it might not always be desirable depending on how null values are intended to be treated within the broader application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the code using a JavaScript runtime (e.g., Node.js).
4. Observe that the output for cases involving null is 0.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust approach, using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to handle null values more gracefully. This approach allows the function to either use a default value or throw an error based on context.

## Potential Improvements

- Consider using stricter input validation to ensure that the function is only called with numbers, handling other types explicitly. 
- Implement more robust error handling that provides more context about invalid input. 
- Clearly document how the function handles null or other unusual input values in its API documentation.
